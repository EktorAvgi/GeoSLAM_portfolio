      <h2>
        Scanning is a process which may have multiple aspects that users may not
        take account when they start the scanning process. Each scanning may
        have different purpose such as indivual scans, scans with the purpose of
        merging or scans for colourising purpose. Indiidual scans can be
        considered as the simplest ones as the data-sets do not need to be
        combined directly with another data of any format, but rather for
        post-processing projects such as visualisation either 2D sections or
        layouts or 3D for collection information related to the geometry of the
        environment or the feature that is been scanned.
      </h2>
      <br />
      <h2><b>Individual scans</b></h2>
      <h2>
        Is the process of collecting the geometry of 3D objects within an
        environment the user is in. It can capture free-form shapes and quickly
        generate a highly accurate 3D point cloud through a specialised
        software. The results appear - depending on the scan duration - in
        thousands or million of points representing the feature in 3D. Its
        purpose can be for inspection through the application software in PDF
        format report colouring deviations.
      </h2>
      <br />
      <h2><b>Merge multiple scans</b></h2>
      <h2>
        Is the process of collecting multiple scans and register them to each
        other either in local or in any geodetic system. Key point in such scans
        is to have control points such as spherical targets or checkerboard
        targets based on which the registration process may be applied. The
        merging process can be devided into two parts. The rigid transformation
        (HUB & Draw) and the non-rigid transformation (HUB). The rigid
        transformation is based on control points where the user can apply in
        Draw by importing the coordinates of certain known targets (Draw); or
        move the point cloud (align close to the reference one) in the all 3
        axis until the point clouds will meet (approximately) each other (HUB).
        Subsequently, the algorithm will apply the non-rigid transformation
        where it introcuces the matching feature algorithm automatically. In
        this part, it is very important for the user to have overlaps i.e. 30%
        so the algorithm can detect enough features for the registration
        purpose.
      </h2>
      <br />
      <h2><b>Scans for colourisation purpose</b></h2>
      <h2>
        Is the process of collecting video in addition to point cloud for the
        purpose of either the colourisation or the combination of video next to
        3D point cloud. The colourisation process is a bit different as the
        camera has smaller field of view compared to the laser scanner sensor.
        Hence, the user should point on different directions the device so the
        camera can collect frames of the same object from different point of
        views. The walking speed should also be sloewer compared to the
        individual scans.

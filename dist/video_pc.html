      </h2>
      <h2>
        To process your data-sets and see the 3D point cloud results, users will
        need to download the raw data from the data logger in the usb stick and
        copy it into the local machine. Subsequently, from the local machine the
        raw data can dragged and dropped into HUB for processing them.
      </h2>

      <h2>
        <b>Note:</b> The raw data should be copied in the local machine and then
        drag and drop into HUB. Users may not be able to drag and drop data from
        either the local network or the USB stick directly.

      <h2>
        <b style="color: #f2911e; font-size:25px">Reprocessing data-sets</b>
      </h2>
      <h2>
        Some times user may get incorrect output results by processing data-sets
        with the default parameters. Reprocessing data-sets, may help to improve
        or fix the geometry of the output results. This some times can be time
        consuming as the reason may not be very clear for many cases. To find a
        solution, users need to understand the parameters that have been set in
        the User Interface and modifying them accordingly. Since the geometry of
        each feature is different as well as the walking speed varies for each
        scan, each case can have different solution for parameter changes. Below
        is the description of each parameter.
      </h2>
      <br />
      <h2><b>Local Registration Options</b></h2>
      <br />
      <h2>
        <b>- Convergence threshold:</b> It is the “point” at which the algorithm
        stops the process/iterations when it meets the default value i.e. when
        the normalised residuals of the iterations is less than the default
        value. Increasing this parameter increases the number of iterations
        which subsequently reduces the threshold value.
      </h2>
      <br />
      <h2>
        <b>- Window size:</b> This parameter is a combination of 3
        sub-parameters. It depends on the duration size of the window, the
        duration of the window that will be shifted for each iteration during
        the local phase and the duration of the previous surface element data
        that is been used as a set of fixed view. This impacts directly on how
        much each part of the trajectory will be optimised for the next
        portion/part. It is effectively the accuracy against the time slider for
        which increasing this value the algorithm will consider using bigger
        samples of data during each processing step. Though increasing it will
        require more memory otherwise it will end with an error message.
      </h2>
      <br />
      <h2>
        <b>- Voxel Density:</b> This parameter defines the size of the smaller
        volume element that should be used to compute subsequently the surface
        elements that the scanner has acquired. Increasing this parameter will
        make the algorithm to consider smaller volume elements for the
        computation and force more detail to be detected at close range.
        However, depending on the environment and the requirement this can be
        changed i.e. smaller values increase the mapping speed but not the
        accuracy unfortunately.
      </h2>
      <br />
      <h2>
        <b>- Rigidity:</b> This parameter is related to noise removing
        constraint by changing subsequently the angular velocity and the
        acceleration of the laser scanner head. Increasing this parameter will
        cause the algorithm to be more tightly constraint and subsequently more
        “rigid” during the local registration phase. In other words, the
        algorithm will be more influenced by the collected from the IMU and less
        influenced by the data collected from the sensor of the laser scanner
        head when estimating the trajectory.
      </h2>
      <br />
      <h2>
        <b>- Maximum Range (metres):</b> This parameter enables the user to
        define the range of points that will be included for the computation of
        the final point cloud. The range is calculated as the distance between
        the features and the trajectory. Points which belong further away from
        the maximum range will be ignored from the final output. It is useful
        for cases where the feature-buildings are relatively small.
      </h2>
      <br />
      <img src="img/parameters_1.jpg" alt="UI" class="parameters_1" /><br />
      <h2>
        <b>- Modifying bounding box:</b> With this parameter the user can change
        the default bound box used in order to eliminate the operator from the
        scan. By default, the bounding box is set to exclude points collected
        from human operator from the actual scan (points inside the bounding box
        are ignored). It can also help on cases where the user scans manholes
        due to the size of them.
      </h2>
      <h2>
        Increasing the bounding box dimensions helps to eliminate more points
        around the scanner mounted on UAVs, cradles or other systems. If narrow
        spaces are scanned, reducing the bounding box will include the points at
        the closer range (points close to the scanner), though might also
        introduce noise points when it is too small.
      </h2>
      <br />
      <h2>
        <b>- Range filter slop:</b> This parameter is responsible of “removing”
        or better filter out ghost points. By default, the algorithm discards
        outlier points or points which do not appear to be part of a continuous
        surface. As a result, the feature is responsible for providing more
        clean output results. In environments such as forestry or stockpile, the
        results can be significant cleaner.
      </h2>
      <br />
      <h2>
        <b>- Prioritise laser constraints:</b> By default, this parameter is
        disabled for Horizon processing data. For RT collected data, in certain
        cases (depending on the geometry of the feature and the duration of the
        scan), it can help for improving the output results. As it had appeared
        in the first place on the results that the user had seen while he was
        scanning.
      </h2>
      <br />
      <h2>
        <b>- End processing early:</b> This parameter can help to generate
        output results by forcing the algorithm to end the processing operation
        earlier. This option can be used in cases of slip or drift at the end or
        at some point during the scan. User can insert time after which the
        processing will finish and everything that was captured after that
        certain time will be ignored.
      </h2>
      <h2>
        In our newest version of HUB, an error message will appear with the time
        that something went wrong. The user can then reprocess again the raw
        data by setting the time to finish earlier in order to get output
        results.
      </h2>
      <h2>
        <b>Note:</b> Start/Finished closed loop must be unticked when using this
        option.
      </h2>
      <br />

          >Global Registration Options</b
        >
      </h2>
      <br />
      <h2>
        <b>- Prioritise planar surfaces:</b> Selecting this option will cause
        the algorithm to only match very planar surfaces during the global
        registration phase. This can help improve the global registration of
        very large data sets assuming there are enough points to define planar
        surfaces at the points where there is loop closure.
      </h2>
      <h2>
        The parameter restricts 2 surface elements so that their positions are
        planar with respect to each other’s normal. This indicates that the
        movement along the plane is fine (See below).
      </h2>
      <br />
      <img src="img/parameters_3.jpg" alt="UI" class="parameters_1" /><br />

      <h2>
        <b>- Start/Finish closed loop:</b> The default for this setting is
        enabled. Disable this setting if the end of the scan is not in the same
        location as the start. This checkbox, when checked by default will force
        the start and end points to be pulled together before the start of the
        Global registration.
      </h2>
      <br />
      <img src="img/parameters_4.jpg" alt="UI" class="parameters_1" /><br />

      <h2>
        <b>- Convergence threshold:</b> It is the “point” at which the algorithm
        stops the process/iterations when it meets the default value i.e. when
        the normalised residuals of the iterations is less than the default
        value. Increasing this parameter increases the number of iterations
        which subsequently reduces the threshold value.
      </h2>
      <br />
      <h2>
        <b>- Rigidity:</b> This parameter is related to noise removing
        constraint by changing subsequently the angular velocity and the
        acceleration of the laser scanner head. Increasing this parameter will
        cause the algorithm to be more tightly constraint and subsequently more
        “rigid” during the local registration phase. In other words, the
        algorithm will be more influenced by the collected from the IMU and less
        influenced by the data collected from the sensor of the laser scanner
        head when estimating the trajectory.
      </h2>
      <br />
      <h2>
        <b>- Draft mode:</b> This parameter responsible for producing faster
        output results, but not accurate as it computes points acquired from
        less rings during the scan.
      </h2>
      <br />

      <h2>
        <b style="color: #f2911e; font-size:25px">Adding Video</b>
      </h2>
      <h2>
        After processing the raw data, users may add video in order to implement
        semantic information in the 3D point cloud as the point cloud itself
        represents pure geometry of the feature(s). This can be done only in
        cases where there is CAM IMU information recorded in the raw data. To be
        sure that the data is been recorded, users can see - after processing
        the data - if there is camera icon in your data (see below the
        screenshot). Once the video data will be added for the purpose of
        colourisation, users will be able to see the painting palette which
        indicates that the point cloud is been colourised.
